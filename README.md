## IoT-based Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System

### Description
Indoor air quality is crucial for maintaining a healthy and comfortable environment. Poor air quality, caused by excessive **CO₂**, **VOCs**, and unsuitable **temperature and humidity** levels, can lead to health issues and decreased productivity.

This project, developed by **SyncCore**, aims to create an IoT-based **Indoor Air Quality Monitoring System** that continuously tracks key environmental factors:
- **Temperature**
- **Humidity**
- **Equivalent CO₂ (eCO₂)**
- **Total Volatile Organic Compounds (TVOC)**

Using the **ESP32 microcontroller**, sensor readings are transmitted to an **MQTT-based backend server** over Wi-Fi. The collected data is processed, analyzed, and displayed on a **real-time dashboard**, allowing users to monitor air quality trends and take action when necessary.

#### **Features**
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously tracks and updates air quality parameters.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Displays data trends and alerts through an intuitive interface.
- **IoT Connectivity:** Uses Wi-Fi and MQTT protocols for efficient communication.
- **Scalability:** Can be extended with additional sensors and multiple locations.
- **Instant Alerts:** Notifies users when air quality parameters exceed safe thresholds.

#### **User Interfaces of Mobile App**
